# 101company

## Headline
Web programming in Language:Ruby with Technology:Ruby on Rails

## Characteristics 
We exercised Web Programming to implement a new contribution to 101company. We used the well-known framework Ruby on Rails. 
The original part of our implemantation is, that we invest a lot of time in a nice looking frontend. Futhermore there are not so many Rails contributions yet.
So it should be a very interesting repository to other people visiting the 101wiki. For more informations about used languages and technologies just look at the 'Metadata' below.

## Architecture
Standard rails project structure.
For more information visit http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-directory-structure.htm

## Usage 
We deployed our application on Heroku, so that you can test it very easily without any building effort on your side.
